#summary About CC65.

= CC65 =

CC65 (http://www.cc65.org/) is a C compiler suite for 6502 (and similar) CPU. As assembler for my projects targeting machines with this (or compatible) CPUs I usually choose the assembler (and linker) of the CC65 package.

So don't be confused: even if I say, you need cc65 installed to compile my software, it's an assembly project (*I just don't use the C compiler part*).

CA65 is the assembler of the CC65 package, LD65 is the linker. CL65 (what I use) is a "frontend" so you don't need to assemble+link "manually" for simple projects, that's all.

As a Linux user I'm not interested in windows issues (but you can find something "win32" there too). If you are a RedHat (or other distribution uses rpm packages) you can download them from the RedHat directory. If you use Debian based distribution (Ubuntu, or similar with deb packages) you can compile it from source, or you can use the tool called "alien" (you must install it first of course, as root: _apt-get install alien_), and then you can convert the rpm files into deb ones, which are installable then. Not a very nice solution but it worked for me (when I was lazy to compile it from source).
