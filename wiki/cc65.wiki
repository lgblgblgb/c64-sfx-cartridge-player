#summary About CC65.

= CC65 =

CC65 (http://www.cc65.org/) is a C compiler suite for 6502 (and similar) CPU. As assembler for my projects targeting machines with this (or compatible) CPUs I usually choose the assembler (and linker) of the CC65 package.

So don't be confused: even if I say, you need cc65 installed to compile my software, it's an assembly project.
