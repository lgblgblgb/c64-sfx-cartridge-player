#summary About AdPlug

= About AdPlug =

From [http://adplug.sourceforge.net/ AdPlug]'s site: "AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player library, mainly written in C++ and released under the LGPL. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) and Sound Blaster (Dual OPL2/OPL3) audio boards, directly from its original format on top of an emulator or by using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback."

AdPlug's source is especially useful for me at my [IMF] problems (check that wiki page out). It seems the solution for that problem can be examined [http://adplug.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/adplug/adplug/src/imf.cpp?view=markup&pathrev=MAIN in this source file].
