#summary DRO format

= The DRO format =

DRO (DOSBox Raw OPL) is the "AdLib register event capture" format of DOSBOX: http://www.dosbox.com/

My C64 player only supports version 2 of this format and there is *no check* for that: any file is treated as a DRO one, even if it's not, so you must be careful with this! Also currently it's a compile time option to include the DRO file, you cannot select one to play on your C64!

Currently [IMF] format is playable in a way that you have to convert it (on your PC, not C64) into DRO, which is (hopefully) playable then.

Please note, that only version 2 of this format is supported!
