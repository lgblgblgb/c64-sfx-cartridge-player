#summary DRO format

= The DRO format =

DRO (DOSBox Raw OPL) is the "AdLib register event capture" format of [http://www.dosbox.com/ DOSBOX]. With this feature of DOSBOX, you can capture AdLib tunes from any DOS softwares.

My C64 player only supports version 2 (*DOSBOX version 0.73 or newer is required!*) of this format and there is *no check* for that: any file is treated as a DRO one, even if it's not, so you must be careful with this! Also currently it's a compile time option to include the DRO file, you cannot select one to play on your C64!

Currently [IMF] format is playable in a way that you have to convert it (on your PC, not C64) into DRO, which is (hopefully) playable then.
