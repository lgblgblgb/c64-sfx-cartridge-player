#summary Download and compiling the player.

= Download - Compilation - Usage =

Currently you must download the source and compile it yourself.

= Details =

== Getting the source ==

You can check out [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/checkout the SVN repository], or you can try to [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk browse it], if using SVN is "alien" for you (only the source of the player: [http://c64-sfx-cartridge-player.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/c64_play.asm]).

== Softwares for the compilation ==

Note: I use Linux (but I guess, any UNIX like system is OK). If you have Windows, I can't help you, as I never had any Windows, I can't tell you how to install/compile things using Windows.

You must have [cc65 CA65] installed, I use that as the assembler.
Also you need to have installed [VICE] emulator to test the result but also to build disk image, since [VICE]'s c1541 tool is used. In addition you need GNU make and gcc (with the basic libc6 development libraries).

== Compilation and usage ==

You should read the assembly source file [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/browse/trunk/c64_play.asm c64_play.asm], it contains tons of comments at the beginning including these information.

Note: you need a DRO file to use the player, it's not the part of the source repository!

If everything works, you should see/hear something [demo like this].
