#summary Download and compiling the player.

= Introduction =

Currently you must download the source and compile it yourself.

= Details =

== Getting the source ==

You can check out [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/checkout the SVN repository], or you can try to [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk browse it], if using SVN is "alien" for you (only the source of the player: [http://c64-sfx-cartridge-player.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/c64_play.asm]).

== Compilation and usage ==

You should read the assembly source file [http://code.google.com/p/c64-sfx-cartridge-player/source/browse/trunk/c64_play.asm c64_play.asm], it contains tons of comments at the beginning including these information.

Note: you need a DRO file to use the player, it's not the part of the source repository!

If everything works, you should see/hear something [demo like this].
