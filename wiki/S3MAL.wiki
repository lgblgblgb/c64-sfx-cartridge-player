#summary S3M (AdLib) Lite format

= S3MAL - S3M (AdLib) Lite =

[S3M] is a nice format for store AdLib songs (digital sampled version - which is the most common as with any module format - is not interesting for us now). However it has some complexity which is not always needed if we want only AdLib instruments, easy usage on a C64, and so on.

S3MAL is my own creation to have a simplified format. Strictly speaking, it's not even a format, the converter which produces S3MAL from S3M generates assembly files which must be compiled with the [cc65 CA65 assembler]. You can - in theory - assemble that file, but it's useless, as information encoded as labels. This is natural however, since the purpose of S3MAL is to build a song into your program: *it's not a loadable format*.

= Details =

The generated assembly file (which is ([cc65 CA65 assembler] syntax!) contains the following important labels you must use:

s3mal_order_table

It's the order table, containing bytes. The end of the table can be known if you read byte $FF.

s3mal_patterns_lo
s3mal_patterns_hi

Low&high bytes of the addresses of the patterns.

s3mal_inst_lo
s3mal_inst_hi

Low&high bytes of the addresses of the instruments
