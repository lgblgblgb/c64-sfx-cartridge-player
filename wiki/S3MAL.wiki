#summary S3M (AdLib) Lite format

= S3MAL - S3M (AdLib) Lite =

[S3M] is a nice format for store AdLib songs (digital sampled version - which is the most common as with any module format - is not interesting for us now). However it has some complexity which is not always needed if we want only AdLib instruments, easy usage on a C64, and so on.

S3MAL is my own creation to have a simplified format. It's not compatible with S3M (an [S3M] player won't load S3MAL and vice versa). Currently it's under development.
