# How to send PR (pull-request)

"Just do it" - you (and even me!) will see what will happens. :)

OK, seriously, some key points though:

* Clearly, any help is welcome!
* Please open an issue ticket first, let's discuss things there first
* Wait for the decision that "yes, I would love that PR" - or something
* Please use a clean branch to send from, I don't like having PRs with tons of merging etc included, if you feel you need to play with those, just do it, but then apply your changes to a clean tree again, and send from there
* Refer to the ticket by #NUM in your PR clearly
* Do not feel offended if your contribution is denied because it's
not suitable for the project because of some LOGICAL reason, including
the fact, that I don't need such a feature at all (but surely the
reason is **never** personal because of the contributor herself/himself).
* Do not feel offended if you are asked to modify things your
contribution to be accepted, even if it's the 32932937297th time on
the very same contribution try of yours :)
