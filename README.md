# Welcome #

Commodore 64 [AdLib](AdLib.md) player using [SFX Sound Expander cartridge](SFX.md) (with [YM3812](AdLib.md)). If you are interested how I can get the idea to code this, read [the story](story.md). The purpose of this page is to distribute the player but also to document various topics related to AdLib/[the cartridge](SFX.md)/file formats and related issues&solutions using the wiki engine of Google Code service.

# Capabilities #

Currently only [DRO](DRO.md) v2 ([DOSBOX](http://www.dosbox.com/) 0.73 or later can produce it) files are supported, and must be compiled into the source! [IMF](IMF.md) files are supported in a way that you have to convert them before you can play them. Supporting [S3M](S3M.md) is a future plan. If you have idea to support more formats, please tell me!

# The hardware #

Currently it's a C64 project, using [SFX Sound Expander cartridge](SFX.md), but check this out as well: [hardware](hardware.md).

# Demo #

For a little demo without C64 and the cartridge, you can watch [this youtube video](demo.md). Note: it's done with [VICE](VICE.md) emulator, so maybe it does not sound the exactly same way as it would on a real [cartridge](SFX.md) though!

# Software download #

You must download the source, and compile it yourself. For more information visit this link: [download](download.md). To have an overview on all included additional tools in this project, visit [this page](softwares.md).

# Personal notes #

If you want to support my hobby, **please donate me an [SFX Sound Expander cartridge](SFX.md)**, as I only develop using the [VICE](VICE.md) emulator now which emulates the [cartridge](SFX.md) as well. But that is not the real thing. By the way, I am **so open to get a SuperCPU cartridge as well**, especially for C128 mode too, also an **IDE64** would be nice. :)

Please check my [thanks](thanks.md) page out.

Contact me if you have ideas, fixes, patches, or if you use my source in your project (when you must comply to the rules of GNU GPL license, btw).

Also please contact me if you have free-to-distribute [IMF](IMF.md)/[DRO](DRO.md)/[S3M](S3M.md) files which I can include on this site.

# Please "+1" my hobby :) #
